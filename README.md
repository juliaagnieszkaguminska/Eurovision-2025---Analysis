# Eurovision 2025 Analysis 

I am a Eurovision fan, thus I created this project.
This repository contains a comprehensive data-driven Eurovision Song Contest 2025 Grand Final analysis. Using official jury and public voting results alongside real-time YouTube view counts, we explore the relationship between contest performance and audience engagement.

## Key Components

1. **Data Collection**
   - **Points**: Official Grand Final scores (Jury + Televote).
   - **YouTube Views**: Real-time view counts from the Eurovision channel for each live performance video.
   - (Optional) **Spotify Streams**: Proxy for longer-term streaming popularity.

2. **Metrics & Methodology**
   - **Pearson Correlation (r)**: Measures linear association between contest points and YouTube view counts.
   - **Linear Regression & RÂ²**: Quantifies how well points predict viewership; slope indicates average views gained per point.
   - **Views-Per-Point (VPP) Index**: A single KPI that normalizes view counts by score to flag over- and under-performing acts.
   - **Outlier Detection**: Identifies acts that significantly over- or under-performed relative to their jury/public score.

3. **Technical Stack**
   - **Python**: Pandas for data wrangling, Plotly for interactive visualizations.
   - **YouTube Data API v3**: Automated retrieval of view counts (requires API key).
   - **Google Colab**: Reproducible notebook environment.

## Insights & Highlights

- **Strong but Incomplete Alignment**: Pearson r â‰ˆ 0.77 highlights a robust correlationâ€”higher-scoring acts generally attract more views, but ~40% of viewership variance lies outside of vote totals.
- **Predictive Power**: Linear regression reveals that each additional contest point corresponds to ~14â€¯k extra YouTube views on average (RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.59).
- **Viral Champions & Gaps**:
  - ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹ *Austria* over-delivered by +2â€¯200 views/pt (highest VPP).
  - ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ *Italy* under-performed by â€“10â€¯000 views/pt, suggesting a â€œdigital reach gap.
    **Actionable Roadmap**:
  1. **Enrich the Model**: Incorporate artist Spotify followers, social media buzz, and TikTok activity to improve explanatory power.
  2. **Real-Time Tracking**: Schedule automated API pulls to capture view spikes and engagement surges.
  3. **Embed VPP KPI**: Use the Views-Per-Point index as a standard metric for future contests and marketing strategies.
